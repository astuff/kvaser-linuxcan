README for Kvaser firmware upgrade utility
With this tool it is currently possible to upgrade the firmware of Kvaser PCIe
devices.

There are two different variants of the Kvaser firmware upgrade utility:
  * kv_flash_prog, which relies on Kvaser linuxcan drivers and CANlib
  * kv_flash_prog_mmap, is a standalone tool which does not require
    any vendor specific driver

The standard variant, kv_flash_prog, is preferred for anyone using Kvaser
CANlib. The standalone variant, kv_flash_prog_mmap, is preferred when you do
not want to build and install Kvaser linuxcan drivers nor CANlib. Typically when
you use SocketCAN.
This README will only cover the standard kv_flash_prog.
See linuxcan/kvflash/mmap/README for more details about kv_flash_prog_mmap.


By default kv_flash_prog will execute in interactive mode, where available and
supported Kvaser devices are listed, the user needs to select one of the listed
devices. Before the firmware upgrade is started the user need to confirm.

When the --list option is used, it will return a list all compatible devices
with list index and exit. It is not possible to use any of the other options
together with --list.

When the --dryrun option is used, the device firmware is compared with the image
provided by the user, and the firmware is not upgraded.

kv_flash_prog will exit with a status of zero if firmware upgrade was
successful. Status zero is also returned when a dry run is successfully executed,
regardless of whether the image matched or not.
A status of one will be returned if kv_flash_prog encountered any errors before
the image was flashed (e.g file does not exists, permission denied, invalid
device selection).
A status of two will be returned if any fatal error occurred during firmware
upgrade.



To build kv_flash_prog
$ cd linuxcan
$ make kvflash
$ ./kvflash/canlib/kv_flash_prog --help

Download the "Kvaser Firmware Update Tool" from the downloads section at
https://www.kvaser.com. It contains the different firmware image files (*.img).
unzip the downloaded FwUpdateTool_xx_yy.zip
The images are sorted after platform. Locate the image matching your device
(for instance for Kvaser PCIEcan 4xHS use pcie/pciecan_00683_fpgasys.img).

It is also possible to execute kv_flash_prog in unattended mode, where no user
input is required. To specify which device to upgrade either use the
--device=<EAN:s/n> option, or --device-index=<index>.

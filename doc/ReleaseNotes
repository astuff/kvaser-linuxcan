Support
================================================================
If you have any problems you are welcome to contact us. 
You will find the contact information on the web at 
http://www.kvaser.com.


================================================================
Version info
================================================================

   * Tested under x86_64 SMP Ubuntu 12.04 x32/x64 (3.2.0-29-generic-pae/3.2.0-23-generic).
   * Tested under x86_64 SMP Ubuntu 13.04 x32/x64 (3.8.0-19-generic/3.8.0-19-generic).
   * Compiled with gcc version 4.6.3 and 4.7.3.
   * Used glibc version 2.15 and 2.17.


================================================================
General information
================================================================
System requirements: Linux 2.6.26 or later.

NOTE! While SMP (and fully preemptible kernel) has seen significant
      testing, it should still be considered somewhat experimental.
      The same applies to use under 64 bit Linux.
      Feedback on use under SMP enabled (or fully preemptible)
      and 64 bit kernels is welcome.
      See the FAQ for information on how to disable SMP.

================================================================  
Known problems
================================================================
   * Firmware bug in Leaf will cause it to start up in silent mode.
     (Set it to normal mode manually using canSetBusOutputControl().)

   * Firmware bug in Leaf will cause it to start up in silent mode.
     (Set it to normal mode manually using canSetBusOutputControl().)

   * Firmware bug in old Leaf firmware will make the driver report
     the wrong bus parameters when queried. Update the Leaf firmware.

   * Virtual CAN driver will not behave as it perhaps should when
     it is "off bus".

   * Single channel PCIcanII may report two channels.

   * It is possible to continue "using" a driver while it is
     trying to shut down. Nothing useful will happen, but the driver
     can be blocked from unloading indefinitely.

   * While the driver implements auto response functionality for all
     hardware, the same is not true for auto tx. The latter is only
     available if there is firmware support in the device.
     (This is the same as under Windows.)


================================================================
Updates in version 5.2
================================================================
   * Changed types in canIfData.h in order to handle 32/64bit
     type differences. This implies that both drivers and
     canlib should be updated together.
     
   * Replaced usage of create_proc_read_entry to
     proc_create_data. Since it is deprecated in kernel 3.10,
     kernels >= 2.6.26 are now required. 
     

================================================================
Updates in version 5.1
================================================================
   * Minor updates to documentation.


================================================================
Updates in version 5.0
================================================================
   * Fixed bug related to local tx echo
   * Added support for Leaf Professional LIN
   * Added LINlib
   * Fixed build issue on ARM targets. (atomic_set_mask)
   * Updated linuxcan documentation.


================================================================
Updates in version 4.82
================================================================
   * Added missing licence files.


================================================================
Updates in version 4.81
================================================================
   * Added missing licence headers
   * Cleaning files using unifdef


================================================================
Updates in version 4.80
================================================================
   * Driver now supports linux kernels > 2.6
   * Reworked make and install script.
   * New ioctl command added to read out hardware revision.
   * pcicanII needs firmware 3.0 or later.
   * Added support for canReadSync
   * Resolved bug related to x64 kernels in function vCanTime
   * Added support for local echo, canIOCTL_SET_LOCAL_TXECHO 
   * Added support for canCHANNELDATA_MFGNAME_ASCII and
     canCHANNELDATA_DEVDESCR_ASCII using canGetChannelData.
